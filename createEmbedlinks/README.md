# Create missing embedlinks for mediahubs
This helper creates missing embedlinks for mediahubs.

You need a update the code in index.js (as commented) with a valid session, the channel you want to use, the playerConfig mapping and other optional stuff.

The script (run with node index.js) will then create missing embedlinks with flag 2 (hidden/mediahub player) and the given playerConfig.
